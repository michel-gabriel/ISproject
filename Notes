COOKIES (BITTREX in chrome)

_cfduid = a cookie that says you passed captcha or some test and do not need to do it again. NO identity associated with this cookie. 
_ga     = Used to distinguish users. expiration 2 years
_gid    = Used to distinguish users. expiration 24 hrs

Cookies are handled entirely by the request header in HTTP header fields, cookies in the client side are encoded in the 'Cookie' 
and 'Set-Cookie' response header and in the server side are encoded in the 'Cookie' request header 

example of client request
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com

COOKIES: 

*SESSION COOKIE = CLEARS WHEN BROSWER EXITS (NOT SESSION ID)

datr = identify the web browser being used to connect to Facebook
  independent of the logged in user. This cookie plays a key role in Facebook’s security and site
  integrity features
 
wd =  stores the browser window dimensions and is used by Facebook to optimise the
  rendering of the page
  
presence = The presence cookie is used to contain the user’s chat state. For example, which chat tabs are
  open.
  This cookie is a session cookie.
  
locale = This cookie contains the display locale of the last logged in user on this browser. This cookie
  appears to only be set after the user logs out.
  The locale cookie has a lifetime of one week.
  
 lsd = The lsd cookie contains a random value that is set when a Facebook user logs out in order to
  prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The cross-site request forgery attack is a technique that involves misuse of user credentials from
  one site (in this case Facebook) to perform unauthorised actions on the user’s account when a
  user visits a web site containing specifically crafted malicious code.
  The lsd cookie is a session cookie.

c_user = The c_user cookie contains the user ID of the currently logged in user.
  The lifetime of this cookie is dependent on the status of the ‘keep me logged in’ checkbox. If the
  ‘keep me logged in’ checkbox is set, the cookie expires after 30 days of inactivity. If the ‘keep me
  logged in’ checkbox is not set, the cookie is a session cookie and will therefore be cleared when
  the browser exits.
 
 xs = This cookie contains multiple pieces of information, separated by colon (%3A). The first value is an up
  to two-digit number representing the session number. The second portion of the value is a session secret.
  The third, optional component is a ‘secure’ flag for if the user has enabled the secure
  browsing feature.
  The lifetime of this cookie is dependent on the status of the ‘keep me logged in’ checkbox. If the
  ‘keep me logged in’ checkbox is set, the cookie expires after 30 days of inactivity. If the ‘keep me
  logged in’ checkbox is not set, the cookie is a session cookie.
 
 lu = The lu cookie is used to manage how the login page is presented to the user. Several pieces of
  information are encoded within the lu cookie, as described here.
  The “keep me logged in” checkbox on the Facebook login page is used to determine whether or
  not the authentication cookies delivered to the user when they log in will be retained when the
  user quits their browser. If the “keep me logged in” checkbox is ticked, then when the user logs in,
  the authentication cookies will be persistent (retained after the browser exits). If the “keep me
  logged in” checkbox is not ticked, then the authentication cookies will be session cookies (cleared
  when the browser exits).
  The user can explicitly check or uncheck the “keep me logged in” box. The lu cookie records
  whether the user has performed such an explicit action.
  If the user has not explicitly either checked or unchecked the “keep me logged in” box, then the
  default mode of operation is to automatically check the “keep me logged in box” if the same user
  has logged in from the same computer three times in a row without logging out. A user explicitly
  checking or unchecking the “keep me logged in” box always overrides this feature.
  In order to implement this functionality, the lu cookie contains a counter which is incremented if
  the user logging in is the same as the previous user that logged in from this web browser, and if
  the previous user did not explicitly log out. To be able to determine whether the user logging in
  is the same as the previous user that logged in, the lu cookie contains the user ID of the previously
  logged in user. The previously logged in user component of the lu cookie is set to zero if the user
  explicitly logs out.
  The user ID component of the lu cookie is also used to pre-populate the email address field of the
  login form if the user did not previously explicitly log out.
  To summarise, the components of the lu cookie are:
   The user id of the previously logged in user, or zero if the user explicitly logs out.
   A counter containing the number of times in a row that the same user has logged in from
    from this browser and has not explicitly logged out.
   A flag used to indicate whether the user has explicitly either checked or unchecked the
    “keep me logged in” box.
  The lifetime of the lu cookie is two years.
